# order-app
### Goals:
- Build a landing page for a product using a CSS Framework (Bootstrap, Pure, ...).
- Use only JavaScript Stack
- The app must have at least two screens
- Status available should be: Processing, Separated, Sent and Delivered.
- The user should be able to select more than one product per order.
- Each order should have a history of status changes.

### Considerations
I didn't use much bootstrap in the overall application, but I installed and used a few elements.
I did not implement layout responsiveness to the app.
The app was build using Express 4.16.0 and Angular 5.2.10.

My main difficulties were to integrate the front-end in Angular with the Express REST API.
